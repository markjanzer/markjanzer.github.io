I’m a full-stack software engineer with a strong product sense and a bias toward action. I’ve worked as a founding engineer and helped grow early-stage startups, building scalable, user-focused systems from the ground up.

I’m based in San Francisco and currently working on a few independent projects. I’m open to working with teams looking to level up their development practices—or with anyone who wants to bring an idea to life from scratch.
