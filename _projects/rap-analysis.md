The Rap Analysis Project (RAP) is a web-based tool I built in college as part of a research grant exploring the musical structure of rap lyrics and how they’ve evolved over time. I developed a custom notation system to visually represent the rhythm, rhyme, and accents within a verse—using spacing to show timing, bold text for emphasis, and color to highlight rhyme schemes. Inspired by existing rhyming notations, this approach aimed to make the musicality of rap more accessible for analysis and appreciation. The app itself provides an interface for manually transcribing verses into this format. I presented this work at a musicology conference in Oregon, showcasing how structured lyric notation can offer insight into the craft of rap across different artists and eras.

While the code isn't great to say the least the project remains one I’m proud of and interested in due to the nature of the work. If I were to revisit it, I’d rewrite the app with a modern stack and explore two new directions: static analysis of lyrics (to quantify an artist’s techniques over time), and machine learning models for automatic transcription directly from audio. With advancements in AI, it's now much more feasible to imagine a system that can detect flow, rhyme, and rhythm programmatically—bringing this kind of analysis to a wider audience.
