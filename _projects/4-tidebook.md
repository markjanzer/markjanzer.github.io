Tidebook is a lightweight, spaced repetition flashcard app built for the web, inspired by Anki and my desire to actually retain what LLMs were teaching me. Designed to help reinforce programming syntax and problem-solving strategies, it features a simple interface, category tagging, and a rating system that controls how far in the future cards are scheduled. At its core is a Go implementation of [the Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler algorithm](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki), which I built from scratch to power the review logic.

This was my first full web app in Go and an exploration of HTMX and server-first development. Although HTMX played a smaller role than expected, it helped me embrace a fast, frontend-light approach similar to Rails' Hotwire. Without the opinionated structure of Rails, the biggest challenge was designing the architecture and flow of the app from scratchâ€”routing, templating, and state management all required more manual decisions. Tidebook runs locally for now with a shared database and no auth, but I'm considering open-sourcing it or building on it further, especially with ideas for deeper LLM integration.
