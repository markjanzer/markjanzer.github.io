The Linear Isomorphic Keyboard is a personal project at the intersection of music, design, and software. It explores a simplified take on the piano keyboard—reimagining the layout to reduce complexity and potentially make learning and playing more intuitive. To test the concept, I built a physical prototype using 3D-printed components and repurposed parts from another keyboard. I’ve been practicing on both this alternate layout and a traditional keyboard to see how they compare.

The site itself is built with Rails with Turbo and Stimulus, and includes a lightweight backend to support logging and reviewing practice sessions. I set up basic CRUD functionality so I could easily track my progress and experiment with different practice strategies. It’s part journal, part prototype companion—and a way for me to learn by doing, both in music and in code.
